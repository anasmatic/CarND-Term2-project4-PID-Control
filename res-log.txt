kp=0.05, ki=0, kd=-0.5
kp 0.05 turn good , but crash on second turn
kp 0.1 truns late and turns too slow
kp 0.025 better, but turn late & slow
kp 0.035 better, but similer to 0.025
kp 0.04 better, but crash on second turn
kp 0.045 better bearly pass 2nd term, but still turn late

changing kd to 0.5
kp=0.045, ki=0, kd=0.5
kd=0.5 can't pass turn 1 ! late turn and swings hard
kd=0 passed turn 1 but swing hard, crashed on bridge
kd=-1 swing less , but still late turn, crashed on 2nd turn
kd=-2 passed project , steer on time hard steering, but no swings at all
build version a01

changing kp to 0.05
kp 0.05 do not feel better, and crash on turn 2

changing kp to 0.1, kd=-2.0
kp=0.1, ki=0, kd=-2.0
passed project , steer hard on time, no swings
build version a02

comparing a01(kp=0.045,ki=0,kd=-2),a02(kp=0.1,ki=0,kd=-2)
a02 is better, car stays in center when straight
and also in curves it is not getting close to edges
but in booth stearing is hard, beeds smoothing

after couple of trials using prevoius logic, I'll stop at :
kp=0.15,ki=0,kd=-3.0

now I'll tune ki
ki=10 constant hard left turn, crash
ki=1 , .1 ,0.001, same 
nigative -0.0001 is good
but keep it 0

next : build twaddle

after lots of trials: car is able to drive save if twaddle was init with thses values
t = 0.7, n = 30
p = 0.3 0 10 , pd = 0.1 0 1
p is very similer to actual values

also working with :
t = 0.7, n = 5
p = 0.02 0 10 , pd = 0.1 0 1

also working with :
t = 0.7, n = 5
p = 0 0 10 , pd = 0.1 0 1

t = 0.7, n = 5
p = 0 0 1 , pd = 0.1 0 1

t = 0.1, n = 5
p = 0 0 1 , pd = 0.1 0 1 
=== 0.787 0 8.908

t=0.1, n=5, s=0.4
p=0 0 0 , pd=0.1 0 1 
=== 0.900 0 9.828

t=0.1, n=5, s=0.4
p=0 0 0 , pd=0.1 0 1 
=== 

t=0.1, n=10, s=0.4
p=0 0 0 , pd=1 0 15 
=== 3.11 0 82.15

t=0.1, n=5, s=0.4
p=0 0 0 , pd=1 0 15
